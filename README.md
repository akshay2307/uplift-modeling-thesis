John Wanamaker known as father of modern marketing has once said "I know half of the money I spend on Advertising is wasted, but the trouble is I don't know which half."

Incremental Response Modelling also known as Uplift Modelling or Net lift Modelling is a technique which is used to identify those customers who are likely to respond positively when they are targeted by any marketing action and not likely to respond if not approached. Incremental Response modelling has applications in different areas of customer retention and demand generation. The other big successes have come in the area of cross-sell and up-sell, particularly of high-value financial products. Here, purchase rates are often low, and the overall incremental impact of campaigns is often small. Uplift modelling often allows dramatic reduction in the volumes targeted while losing virtually no sales. In some case, where negative effects are present, incremental sales actually increase despite a lower targeting volume. 

The main purpose of this web application is to develop a user interface where user can select input data, perform data pre processing tasks, perform incremental response modeling on the data and download the results for further analysis. These findings could be used in future campaigns to end out the customers whom should the company target for next marketing action. 

Thesis Structure:
Thesis is divided in the following chapters:
- Chapter 2 provides introduction about Incremental Response Modelling and its
motivation
- Chapter 3 deals with the detailed overview of Incremental Response Modelling
- Chapter 4 explains the test data used in this Thesis Work.
- Chapter 5 provides various data cleaning tasks performed prior to incremental
response modelling
- Chapter 6 provides details about the variable pre-screening step using Net infor-
mation value method (NIV)
- Chapter 7 gives information about the two different methods used to calculate the
incremental score
